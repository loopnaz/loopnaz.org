We are committed to making our site accessible for everyone.

## Minimum standards

Our site meets or exceeds [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) Level AA.

## Additional considerations

We also take the following measures to ensure our site remains accessible:

* Use clear written language
* Make the user interface easy to understand
* Run automated and manual tests for accessibility
* Honor users’ system preferences for lighter or darker color schemes
* Limit file sizes and device memory loads
* Publish our source code in a [public repository](https://github.com/loopnaz/loopnaz.org/), allowing anyone to inspect it and suggest changes
* Document our code to welcome contributors, including those with little or no programming experience
